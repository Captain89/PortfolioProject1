# DoggyWoggy

Welcome to [DoggyWoggy](https://github.com/Captain89/PortfolioProject1.git) The meet and greet website for owners to take their furry best pals on a fun and friendly walk with others and there dogs too! 

The website is targeted at dog owners who want to join in social walks with others and their dogs, instead of taking their pets on a walk alone. The site is designed to encourage users to see the different walks that we currently offer, and book or enquire with us about our services in relation to dog walking as a group.

## Current Features

* Navigation Bar:

    The fully responsive navigation bar includes the main logo which links back to the main website page itself, and also three other menu links: About us, Join in, and Contact. The links are highlighted bold with css animation when hovered over, and each link will take the user to the associated area of the site.

* The landing page image:

    The main landing page features an image of our beach walk, with some text overlay over the image to provide a useful 'hint' or 'nod' as to what the aim of the site is about.

* About Us Section:

    The about us section is the main body of text for the website, housed in an eye catching, easy to read container that helps explain who we are, and what we do. Also inside the text section are two links, one to the 'Join in' section, and the other to the 'Contact' section. The site user is encouraged to read the about us content, as it is short and sweet, providing the user with an instant understanding of what services the site aims to provide, and book a walk using the contact section.

* Join In Section:

    This section allows the site user to clearly see the three walks we have currently available, the beach walk, the woodland walk, and the city walk.

    The walks are explained through visual 'cards' containing images to a likeness of our walks as an example, and the images used are from [Pexels.](https://www.pexels.com/)
